        ============================================================
        A task is an activity within the search process.  The original task
        is to optimize the entire query.  Tasks create and schedule each
        other; when no pending tasks remain, optimization terminates.
    
        In Cascades and Columbia, tasks store winners in memos; they do not
        actually produce a best plan.  After the optimization terminates,
        SSP::CopyOut() is called to print the best plan.
    
        TASK is an abstract class.  Its subclasses are specific tasks.
    
    
        Tasks must destroy themselves when done!

        O_GROUP - Task to Optimize a Group
        ============================================================
        This task finds the cheapest multiplan in this group, for a given
        context, and stores it (with the context) in the group's winner's circle.
        If there is no cheapest plan (e.g. the upper bound cannot be met),
        the context is stored in the winner's circle with a null plan.
    
        This task generates all relevant expressions in the group, costs them 
        and chooses the cheapest one.
    
        The determination of what is "cheapest" may include such issues as
        robustness, e.g. this task may choose the multiplan with smallest
        cost+variance.  Here variance is some measure of how much the cost
        varies as the statistics vary.
        
        There are at least two ways to implement this task; we will discover which 
        is best.
    
        First, Goetz' original way, is to process each multiexpression separately,
        in the order they appear in the list/collection of multiexpressions.  To
        process an expression means to determine all relevant rules, then fire them 
        in order of promise().
    
        Second, hinted at by Goetz, applies only when there are multiple expressions 
        in the group, e.g. after exploring.  Here we can consider all rules on all
        expressions, and fire them in order of their promise.  Promise here may include
    	a lower bound estimate for the expressions.

        ============================================================
        E_GROUP - Task to Explore the Group
        ============================================================
        Some rules require that their inputs contain particular (target) operators.  For
        example, the associativity rule requires that one input contain a join.  The
        E_GROUP task explores a group by creating all target operators that could
        belong to the group, e.g., fire whatever rules are necessary to create all
        joins that could belong to the group.
    
        The simplest implementation of this task is to generate all logical 
        multiexpressions in the group.  
    
        More sophisticated implementations would fire only those rules which might 
        generate the target operator.  But it is hard to tell what those rules
        are (note that it may require a sequence of rules to get to the target).
        Furthermore, on a second E_GROUP task for a second target it may be
        difficult to use the results of the first visit intelligently.
    
        Because we are using the simple implementation, we do not need an E_EXPR task.
    	Instead we will use the O_GROUP task but ensure that it fires only transformation rules.
    
    	If we are lucky, groups will never need to be explored: physical rules are fired first,
    	and the firing of a physical rule will cause all inputs to be optimized, therefore explored.
    	This may not work if we are using pruning: we might skip physical rule firings because of
    	pruning, then need to explore.  For now we will put a flag in E_GROUP to catch when it does not work.
